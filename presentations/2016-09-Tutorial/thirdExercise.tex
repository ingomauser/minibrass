\begin{frame}{Group Photo as a Soft Constraint Problem} \small
\textbf{Exercise 3}

Now we would like to refine our group photo model with constraint relationships.
Start by examining the ``pure'' MiniZinc model \texttt{groupphoto-pure.mzn} and test it with \texttt{groupphoto1.dzn}.
We will augment this model with preferences, starting with person 3 (Carla). She has three preferences
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathsf{c1}$: She would like to be placed next to person 2. (Hint: Use the provided \texttt{isNextTo} function.)
\item $\mathsf{c2}$: She would like to be placed in the second row.
\item $\mathsf{c3}$: Carla doesn't particularly like person 5. Hence, the Manhattan distance (provided as \texttt{manhattanDist}) between them should be greater than 4.
\end{itemize}
Constraint $\mathsf{c1}$ is most important to Carla, $\mathsf{c2}$ and $\mathsf{c3}$ are both less important than $\mathsf{c1}$ but incomparable. Write a preference model \texttt{groupphoto.mbr} that incorporates theses constraint relationships. Test the model (not in the IDE) using
\begin{align*}
&\texttt{mbr2mzn groupphoto.mbr} \\
&\texttt{minisearch groupphoto.mzn groupphoto1.dzn} \\
\end{align*}
What is the best solution you get? What happens if we add another constraint $\mathsf{c4}$ that asks for person 5 not to be placed at either border (column $1$ or $m$)?
