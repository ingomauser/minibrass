% Illustrates how partial orders have 
% to be handled differently in propagating 
% lower bounds.

% To play with the script, switch between
% onlyNotDominated or strictly better BAB

% solution degrees are explored in order {3}, {2}, {1}
% constraint relationship states 1 <- 2, 1 <- 3
%   with strictly better, we only get to see {3}
%   with only non-domination, we get both {2} and {3}
