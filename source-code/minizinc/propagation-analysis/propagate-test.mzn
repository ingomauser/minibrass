% how can the solver immediately deduce that x = 1 is a bad idea?
% well quite simple, x = 1 -> violated[1] thus violatedScs \in 1..1, 1..2
% but 1..1 is kicked from violatedScs' domain by the propagation of the simple 
% inequality lhs != rhs in spd_better, thus only 1..2 remains in the domain of violatedScs
% and this value (regardless of assigning y = 1 or y = 2 isn't spd better!

% I need a somewhat more elaborate example to support my point

% my hypothesis remains that, as long as there are multiple values in the domain
% of the valuation, we do not propagate/prune anything, we were lucky this time
% as the variable got fixed by propagation
