Tutorial for using our soft constraint extensions
-------------------------------------------------

1. Start with your usual MiniZinc model
2. Add types for soft constraints (based on reification) 
   by typing
   
include "../soft_constraints.mzn";   
   
   Note that you now already have to provide values 
   for nScs (number of soft constraints) and their 
   penalties.
   
3. To have SPD-worse and TPD-worse available as predicates,
   include "xpd_worse.mzn"
   This will NOT automatically bind the "isWorse"-predicate
   to XPD-worse.
   
4. To bind isWorse to XPD-worse (and obtain penalties 
   from a constraint relationship graph), 
   include "pvs-xpd.mzn" 
   This step will have you enter the constraint 
   relationship as a graph

5. Bind soft constraint violation indicator variables
   to your original model constraints
   
   "x + 1 = y <-> satisfied[1];"
